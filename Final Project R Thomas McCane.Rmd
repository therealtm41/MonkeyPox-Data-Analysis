Can see that for the most part there are very few hospitalizations, reagrdless of confirmed cases. However some countries that historically are not the best at disease management or maybe are less developed appear to have higher rates of hospitalization. 


#Monkey_Pox_Updated data set was made from the original Monkey_Pox and Monkey_Pox_Symptoms datasets. I combed through each dataset finding each country I was going to use in both and then added symptoms and gender from the second dataset to the first.

#with a p value this high, there would be very little differentiation of means and thus gender is not a statistically significant variable for case count. We know this is not true, however, because in the other dataset(Monkey pox gender) we can see that the vast majority of confirmed cases were still male.
